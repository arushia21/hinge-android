People Counter Hinge Engineering Homework Assignment

===================================================================================

Included in this directory is a Product Spec for an app called People Counter. Please build the app to spec and submit it for consideration. In addition, submit a writeup explaining the architectural decisions you made in building the app. For example, if you chose to use an MVC architecture, explain how your code conforms to the standards of MVC. Be sure to explain your thought and decision-making processes. Do not simply describe your code.

For example, the following is good: "When I did X, I considered Y and Z. I decided to go with X because it conforms to principle A."

And the following is not good: "I put X in Y, and Z creates them. Then A calls B and does C."

Any architecture is fine, as long as you explain why you chose it and how your code follows its principles. The only exception is "no architecture" – please do not submit an assignment that puts everything in a single file. We want to see how you organize your code.

Your Deliverables:

Your completed homework assignment (zipped project or Github link)
A writeup explaining your architectural decisions
Homework Tips and Suggestions:

UI details (colors, fonts, sizing, spacing, etc) do not have to be exact. Eyeballed values are fine.
Additional features are not necessary and will not be considered. Please build to the spec and no further.
The Product Spec is not an Engineering Spec. Use any and all engineering best practices you know of to build the app.
This assignment should take between 2–4 hours, though you should feel free to spend as much time as you want on it.
If some part of the spec is vague, please use your best judgment. Unfortunately we may not be able to answer every question.
